<i>This is a project made for Technical University of Sofia.</i>

Develop a computer game database. There are users in the game who have a username and password. Each user has multiple characters that have health, attack, magic points, number of monsters killed. There are two types of heroes - a fighter and a magician. Fighters have defence and magicians have ice attack. There are monsters in the game. They have health, attack, magic points and type (zombie, troll or gnome). The heroes can kill the monsters. There are missions in the game, each mission has a name, description, reward (points). Any characters can complete missions. Make it possible for each different user to authenticate with a name and password and retrieve information about all their characters. Complete the tables with necessary information of your choice.
